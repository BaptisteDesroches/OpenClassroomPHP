### OpenClassroom PHP is a repository that contains an online class was advised to me by my sensei, Mehdi-san, to take.
The main goal is to learn and solidfy my skills in the coding language PHP as much as other server environments such as MySQL and Apache. 
I'm doing this course while being at the clinic.

The OpenClassroom selected by sensei can be found [here](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/918836-concevez-votre-site-web-avec-php-et-mysql/).

Here is the list of the skills I'll be learning:
1. **First basis**: configuration and first scripts
2. **Create your first website**: PHP scripts, debugging & loops
3. **Sharing data beteween pages**: sharing files, stocking data and implementing a connection system
4. **Storing data in a database**: working with a database, using phpMyAdmin, accessing to the data via PHP data objects (PDO)

And that's just the beginning...
